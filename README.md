# Lessons learned
During this project I managed to somehow find my feet and learn how to use Enum classes. This topic along with others puzzled me and really hindered me from piecing together my program. Since the information was spread among multiple classes the challenge was set out to access said information without exposing unnecessary data. I managed to link and access all the information I needed in order to execute my objectives. This was quite fun and I look forward to similar challenges.
